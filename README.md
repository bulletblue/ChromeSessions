Google Chrome Sessions
==============

Sessions for Google Chromeâ„¢ allows you to save all tabs in your current window into a single session for recalling later.  If you've got a bunch of tabs open, all related to a single focus, you can shelve the session and close the tabs or entire window, and single-click to restore it.  Sessions are shared across any machine signed into the same Google account.
